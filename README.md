## Overview of the project :
The volunteers should be able to identify the top ten bacterial species found in their navel. If Improbale Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify if that species is found in their navel.

### Horizontal Bar Chart :
The horizontal bar chart was created with sample_values as the values, otu_ids as the labels & the out_labels as the hover text for the bar on the chart.
